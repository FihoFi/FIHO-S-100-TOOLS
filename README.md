# FIHO-S-100-TOOLS
Tools related to S-100 data model testing and product development.

Setup of the project;
1. PHP- classes reflecting the basic features described in S-100, such as FeatureType, ComplexAttributeType etc. were made
2. An XSL- translation of the machine-readable S-100 Feature catalog was used to re-create the datamodel as extensions to above PHP- classes
3. Additional data-validation and product creation are made by coding using the framework and classes as regular PHP.
4. An (extendable) printer- funciton is used to print out the datamodel for verification.

## Version 0.0.1
